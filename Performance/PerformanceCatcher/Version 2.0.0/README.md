## üöÄ Installation

1. **Download** the `PerformanceCatcher.js` file
2. **Place** it in your `js/plugins/` folder
3. **Enable** the plugin in the Plugin Manager
4. **Configure** the parameters as needed (see Configuration section)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Parameters

### Core Settings

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| **Enable Performance Monitoring** | Boolean | `true` | Monitor plugins for performance issues |
| **Enable Cache Cleanup** | Boolean | `true` | Automatically clean cache on map transfers |
| **Enable Console Reports** | Boolean | `true` | Show detailed reports in developer console |

### Performance Settings

|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| **Performance Warning Threshold** | Number | `16` | Warn when functions take longer than X milliseconds |
| **Cache Cleanup Interval** | Number | `3` | Clean cache every X map transfers (0 = every transfer) |

## üéÆ How It Works

### Performance Monitoring

The plugin automatically wraps plugin functions to monitor their execution time:

```javascript
// Automatically monitors execution time of all plugin functions
Plugin.someFunction() // Takes 25ms -> Warning logged if > threshold
```

### Cache Management

Smart cache cleanup occurs during map transfers:

- **Image Cache**: Removes unused character sprites, tilesets, and pictures
- **Audio Cache**: Clears unused sound effects and music files
- **Tileset Cache**: Resets tileset rendering cache
- **Memory Cleanup**: Forces garbage collection when available

### Memory Monitoring

Continuous monitoring prevents memory leaks:

- **Real-time Tracking**: Monitors memory usage every 30 seconds
- **Warning System**: Alerts when memory exceeds configured threshold
- **Emergency Cleanup**: Automatic cleanup at 80% of memory limit
- **Leak Detection**: Identifies plugins causing memory buildup

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Developer Console Commands

Open Developer Tools (F12) and use these commands:

### Get Performance Report
```javascript
$performanceCatcher.getReport()
```
Returns detailed performance statistics for all plugins.

### Manual Cache Cleanup
```javascript
$performanceCatcher.clearCache()
```
Immediately cleans all caches regardless of interval settings.

### Reset Statistics
```javascript
$performanceCatcher.resetStats()
```
Clears all performance statistics and warning history.

### Check Memory Usage
```javascript
$performanceCatcher.getMemoryUsage()
```
Returns current memory usage information.

## üìä Understanding the Reports

### Performance Report Structure

```javascript
{
  monitoring: {
    enabled: true,
    threshold: 16,
    uptime: 300000
  },
  plugins: [
    {
      name: "TimeSystem",
      totalCalls: 1500,
      totalTime: "245.50",
      averageTime: "0.16",
      maxTime: "25.30",
      warnings: 3,
      functions: [...]
    }
  ],
  memory: {
    used: "156.2 MB",
    total: "180.4 MB",
    limit: "2048.0 MB",
    percentage: "7.6%"
  },
  recentWarnings: [...],
  mapTransfers: 5,
  lastCleanup: "12/25/2025, 3:45:30 PM"
}
```

### Warning Types

- **Performance Warnings**: Functions taking longer than threshold
- **Memory Warnings**: Memory usage exceeding configured limit
- **Cache Warnings**: Issues during cache cleanup operations

## üéØ Best Practices

### For Game Developers

1. **Monitor During Development**: Keep console reports enabled during testing
2. **Adjust Thresholds**: Fine-tune warning thresholds for your project
3. **Regular Reports**: Check `$performanceCatcher.getReport()` periodically
4. **Memory Management**: Enable memory monitoring for long gameplay sessions

### For Plugin Developers

1. **Function Naming**: Use clear, descriptive function names for better reports
2. **Performance Awareness**: Monitor your plugin's impact on game performance
3. **Cache Consideration**: Design plugins with cache cleanup in mind
4. **Memory Efficiency**: Avoid memory leaks in plugin code

### Recommended Settings

| Game Type | Performance Threshold | Memory Threshold | Cache Interval |
|-----------|----------------------|------------------|----------------|
| **Simple RPG** | 16ms | 500MB | Every 3 maps |
| **Complex RPG** | 25ms | 1000MB | Every 2 maps |
| **Action Game** | 8ms | 1000MB | Every map |
| **Story-Heavy** | 20ms | 800MB | Every 5 maps |

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Q: Plugin reports show no data**  
A: Ensure Performance Monitoring is enabled and other plugins are loaded correctly.

**Q: Cache cleanup causes frame drops**  
A: Increase the Cache Cleanup Interval or disable cleanup during critical scenes.

**Q: Memory warnings appear constantly**  
A: Lower the Memory Warning Threshold or investigate plugins causing memory leaks.

**Q: Console commands don't work**  
A: Make sure the plugin is properly loaded and `$performanceCatcher` is available.

### Performance Impact

The plugin itself is designed to have minimal performance impact:

- **Monitoring Overhead**: ~0.1-0.5ms per monitored function call
- **Memory Usage**: ~2-5MB for statistics storage
- **Cache Cleanup**: ~10-50ms depending on cache size

---

## üìà Advanced Usage

### Custom Performance Monitoring

```javascript
// Monitor custom functions
const startTime = performance.now();
myCustomFunction();
const executionTime = performance.now() - startTime;
console.log(`Custom function took ${executionTime}ms`);
```

### Conditional Cache Cleanup

```javascript
// Trigger cleanup based on custom conditions
if (myCondition) {
    $performanceCatcher.clearCache();
}
```

### Performance Profiling Session

```javascript
// Start fresh profiling session
$performanceCatcher.resetStats();

// Play your game for a while...

// Get comprehensive report
const report = $performanceCatcher.getReport();
console.table(report.plugins);
```
