- ‚ùå **Memory leaks** from accumulated event data
- ‚ùå **Frame drops** during complex event sequences
- ‚ùå **Inefficient processing** of distant or inactive events
- ‚ùå **No visibility** into event performance bottlenecks

### **The Solution**
- ‚úÖ **Smart distance-based processing** - Only handle nearby events
- ‚úÖ **Priority-based execution** - Important events get processed first  
- ‚úÖ **Automatic memory cleanup** - No more event data accumulation
- ‚úÖ **Real-time performance monitoring** - See exactly what's slow
- ‚úÖ **Developer tools** for instant optimization insights

Event Warning Threshold: 8ms
Max Event Distance: 20 tiles
Cleanup Interval: 3 maps
Priority System: Enabled
```

**Action RPGs**
```javascript  
// Optimize for fast-paced gameplay
Event Warning Threshold: 3ms
Max Event Distance: 12 tiles  
Cleanup Interval: 2 maps
Priority System: Enabled (High responsiveness)
```

**Open World Adventures**
```javascript
// Optimize for large maps with many events
Event Warning Threshold: 10ms
Max Event Distance: 25 tiles

Conditional Loading: Enabled
```

### **Development Tips**
- **Enable console reports** during development for insights
- **Monitor performance regularly** with `getReport()` 
- **Adjust distance thresholds** based on your map sizes
- **Use cleanup intervals** appropriate for your game length
- **Test on mobile devices** to verify optimization effectiveness

---

## üîç Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues & Solutions**

**"Events are not responding"**
- Check if Max Event Distance is too low for your map size
- Verify that important events are properly prioritized
- Ensure event triggers are set correctly

**"Performance is still slow"**
- Run `getReport()` to identify specific slow events
- Consider reducing Event Warning Threshold
- Check if other plugins are causing conflicts
- Verify PerformanceCatcher integration for comprehensive analysis

**"Memory usage is still high"**  
- Enable Auto Cleanup and reduce cleanup interval
- Reduce Maximum Pool Size if excessive
- Check for memory leaks in other plugins
- Monitor with PerformanceCatcher for complete memory analysis

### **Debug Commands**
```javascript
// Comprehensive diagnostics
$eventOptimizer.getReport()           // Full performance analysis
$eventOptimizer.getActiveEvents()     // Currently processing events
$eventOptimizer.cleanupEvents()       // Force cleanup cycle
$eventOptimizer.resetStats()          // Start fresh monitoring
```

## üí° Advanced Usage

### **Custom Event Priorities**
EventOptimizer automatically calculates event priorities, but you can influence them:

- **Player interaction events** (Action, Touch triggers) get highest priority
- **Moving events** receive moderate priority boost  
- **Parallel events** receive lower priority (run constantly)
- **Events with graphics** get slight priority boost
- **Performance-based adjustment** - slow events get lower priority over time

### **Integration with PerformanceCatcher**
When used together with PerformanceCatcher:
- **Double monitoring** of event performance for maximum insight
- **Combined reports** show both system-wide and event-specific data
- **Automatic integration** - no additional configuration needed
- **Enhanced debugging** with comprehensive performance analytics

### **Professional Development Workflow**
1. **Development Phase**: Enable all monitoring and console reports
2. **Testing Phase**: Use reports to identify and fix performance issues
3. **Optimization Phase**: Fine-tune thresholds and distance settings  
4. **Production Phase**: Disable verbose console output, keep monitoring
5. **Maintenance Phase**: Regular performance report reviews
