If the annoying "Desktop.ini" bug occurs quick workaround to remove hidden desktop.ini folders.

1) cd C:\Users\<username>\Documents\RMMZ\<ProjectName>

2) del /S /A:H desktop.ini


ALTERNATIVE METHOD FOR ADVANCED USERS:

## CleanSystemFiles.bat 

1) Save the file as CleanSystemFiles.bat in your RPG Maker project's root folder (the same folder where your Game.rpgproject file is)
2) Double-click the .bat file whenever you want to clean up system files
3) It will remove desktop.ini, Thumbs.db, and .DS_Store from all your asset folders
