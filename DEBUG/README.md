## 🚨 CRITICAL NOTICE

**THIS REPOSITORY CONTAINS DEBUG AND DIAGNOSTIC TOOLS ONLY**

These plugins are designed to **DIAGNOSE PROBLEMS**, not solve them permanently.

---

## ⚠️ What These Tools Are

✅ **Emergency diagnostic instruments**  
✅ **Problem identification utilities**  
✅ **Development testing aids**  
✅ **Bug isolation tools**  
✅ **Temporary debugging solutions**

These tools help you **find** what's wrong with your game.

---

## 🚫 What These Tools Are NOT

❌ **NOT production-ready plugins**  
❌ **NOT permanent fixes**  
❌ **NOT meant for released games**  
❌ **NOT performance-optimized**  
❌ **NOT safe for end users**  
❌ **NOT substitutes for proper solutions**

These tools will **break** your game if left in production.

---

## 📋 Usage Rules

### ✅ DO Use These Tools To:
- Diagnose why events aren't triggering
- Test if systems are working in isolation
- Identify conflicting plugins
- Verify game mechanics during development
- Debug complex event sequences
- Isolate problematic code

### ❌ DO NOT Use These Tools To:
- Ship your game
- Fix problems permanently
- Replace proper event logic
- Optimize performance
- Distribute in public demos
- Include in released projects

## 🔧 The Debug Workflow

```
1. Problem Occurs
   ↓
2. Use Debug Tool to Diagnose
   ↓
3. Identify Root Cause
   ↓
4. REMOVE Debug Tool
   ↓
5. Implement Proper Fix
   ↓
6. Test Without Debug Tool
   ↓
7. Ship Clean Code
```

**Debug tools are the thermometer, not the medicine.**

## 🛡️ Before You Release Your Game

**CHECKLIST:**

- [ ] All debug plugins **REMOVED** or **DISABLED**
- [ ] Proper solutions implemented for diagnosed issues
- [ ] Game tested **WITHOUT** debug tools active
- [ ] No references to debug tools in events
- [ ] Save games tested for corruption
- [ ] Performance verified without debug overhead

---

## 📦 What's In This Repository

Each tool includes comprehensive documentation explaining:
- What it does (and why it's dangerous)
- When to use it (debugging only)
- How to use it (temporarily)
- How to remove it (before release)

**All tools come with extensive warnings and safety guidelines.**

## ⚖️ License

Licensed under **Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License**

**You are free to use these tools for debugging**, but you must:
- Give appropriate credit
- **Never ship them in production**
- Understand the risks
- Use them responsibly

---

## 💡 Philosophy

Think of these tools like a mechanic's diagnostic computer:

🔧 **They tell you what's broken**  
🚫 **They don't fix it for you**  
⚠️ **You wouldn't drive with them attached**  
✅ **You remove them after diagnosis**

---

## 🆘 Support

If you're using these debug tools in production, **you're doing it wrong.**

These tools indicate a problem that needs a **proper fix**, not a workaround.

## 🎯 Final Warning

**🚨 THESE ARE NOT SOLUTIONS 🚨**

**These are debugging aids that bypass normal game systems.**  
**They will cause instability, performance issues, and bugs.**  
**They are intentionally aggressive to force diagnosis.**  
**Remove them after you identify the problem.**

---

**Use these tools to diagnose. Fix properly. Ship cleanly.** 🛡️

*Made for developers who need to debug the impossible.*
