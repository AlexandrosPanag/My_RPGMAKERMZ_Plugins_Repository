## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL DISCLAIMER FOR DEBUG TOOLS

**THIS REPOSITORY CONTAINS DEBUG AND DIAGNOSTIC TOOLS ONLY**

While this license permits commercial use, **these specific tools are designed for debugging and development purposes only**. They use aggressive techniques that bypass normal RPG Maker MZ systems and will cause:

- Performance degradation
- Unpredictable behavior
- Potential save game corruption
- Plugin conflicts
- Game instability

**You must REMOVE these debug tools before releasing any commercial or non-commercial game.**

These tools are intended to help you **diagnose problems during development**, not to be included in production builds.

### Proper Usage:
1. ‚úÖ Use during development to diagnose issues
2. ‚úÖ Identify the root cause of problems
3. ‚úÖ Remove the debug tool
4. ‚úÖ Implement proper fixes
5. ‚úÖ Test without debug tools
6. ‚úÖ Release clean code

### Prohibited Usage:
- ‚ùå Including in released games
- ‚ùå Distributing in public demos with debug tools active
- ‚ùå Using as permanent solutions
- ‚ùå Shipping to end users

**By using these tools, you acknowledge that they are diagnostic instruments only and must not be included in production software.**
